<a href="http://campusgrids.com" target="_blank">Campusgrids</a> is a website created for Carleton University students by students for finding clubs and events on campus. It's a great way to discover new activities and promote your own directly to the Carleton community.

As a member of the Campusgrids development team I have built out various features of the website, fixed many bugs, and advocated for the use of the site (obviously!), resulting in the spawn of new clubs at campus which otherwise may have more trouble reaching the Carleton community as a whole.
