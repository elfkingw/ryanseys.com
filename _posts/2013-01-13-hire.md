<h2>Hire me</h2>

As a student in the co-op/internship program at my school, I am always actively looking for exciting work to do. I desire a software project that's as challenging as it is rewarding. I'm really passionate about open-source and web development, and I get a fuzzy warm feeling every time I work with real-time applications.

Send me a message if you think I may fit well with your team. If you're not quite sure yet, and need a bit more convincing, check out my resume below.
