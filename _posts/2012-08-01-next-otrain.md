Ottawa, Ontario is home to the OTrain, a lightrail train that travels between 5 stops, the middle of which is my school, Carleton University. As a daily OTrain commuter, I created <a href="http://nextotrain.com" target="_blank">this webapp</a> for telling me when the next one would arrive at each station.
