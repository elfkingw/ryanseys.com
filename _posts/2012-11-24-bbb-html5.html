    Project: BigBlueButton HTML5 Client
  </h3>
</a>
<p>
  In the summer of 2012, I had the pleasure of working at Blindside Networks, an Ottawa-based startup driving the BigBlueButton project. <a href="http://www.bigbluebutton.org" target="_blank">BigBlueButton</a> is an open-source web conferencing system designed for distance education. It helps educators and students connect and communicate using voice &amp; video, whiteboard/slides, and text chat, all real-time in the browser.
</p>
<p>
  During my stay, I worked on a brand spankin' new client for them in HTML5 to replace their current Flash implementation. Created from the ground up using Node.js, Socket.io, Redis, and lots of javascript I built out the existing features of their client into a brand new, HTML5 version (yes, it works on your phone)!

  Features include meeting rooms with meeting-wide chat, custom uploadable slides with whiteboard functionality (lines/shapes/text annotations, clears/undos, pan/zoom) with real-time syncronization between every member of the meeting simultaneously, all using standard-compliant HTML5 and JavaScript.
