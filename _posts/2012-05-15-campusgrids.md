A social website for Carleton University students used to find clubs and events on campus.

[Campusgrids](http://campusgrids.com/) is a great way to discover new clubs, events and activities at Carleton University. It was created for students by students. I had the pleasure of working on this project in its earlier stages.

As a member of the Campusgrids development team I built out various features of the website in both the front and back-end, as well as fixed many bugs. As an example, I worked on developing instant search results for faster, more efficient searching for users. This involved front-end CSS and JavaScript as well as back-end interactions with the database (MySQL). The site is built using the LAMP software bundle but is currently closed-sourced :(
