Born and raised a proud Canadian, I am a passionate web developer studying software engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. In between hacking on my latest web projects, I enjoy hacking myself into better shape at the gym and hacking together some delicious (and some questionable) meals in my kitchen. My best friends include my Canon DSLR, my Calvin & Hobbes comic book collection and caffiene.

### History

In my earlier childhood I grew up wanting to build things. I always took apart my toys, intrigued about what was inside ...and sometimes I was even able to put them back together. As I grew up, I was also always recognized for my computer skillz, and computers seemed to enjoy me as I enjoyed them. Once I realized you can actually make stuff with computers, almost like creating something from nothing, I was instantly hooked on all things software development. I pursued software engineering as a career from the start of highschool, and in university I began pursuing web development as a focus.  This is where I am today.

### Future

I plan to continue my pursuit for a career in web development until I graduate from university. Nobody knows what comes after that, and I enjoy the feeling of not knowing.
