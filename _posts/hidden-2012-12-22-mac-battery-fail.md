I've had my Macbook Pro for a little less than two years now, originally buying it in mid-2011. My experience with my Mac has been nothing but sunshine and butterflies, where the most of my issues came simply from the transition from Windows and Linux. Three weeks ago, however, my battery started acting rather out-of-the-ordinary. Firstly it would last only a few hours (at most) whereas typically it would last more than 4. It also showed in Mac OSX that it required service. I ignored these pleas, figuring that it was a faulty sensor and that my battery was indeed fine. Then slowly that few hours turned into less than 1, and one morning I noticed it wouldn't turn on at all. Mac OSX said "Replace battery", this all occuring within a two-week period.

For those without a Macbook, it should be said that the Macbook features a useful row of lights on the side, which light up to tell you the remaining battery life. When your battery is dead, one light would blink 5 times to alert you to charge your computer. When I checked to see what this row of lights showed, it didn't light up **at all**.

It was REALLY dead.
